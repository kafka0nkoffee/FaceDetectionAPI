//planning the structure of the API:

/*

/ --> a root route that for now will res.send that it's working

/signin --> a POST request carrying some JSON data and will respond with either success or fail

/register --> a POST request that will respond with a newly created user so we know that everything is working

/profile/:userId --> a GET request, an optional parameter of 'userId' so that each user has their own homescreen.

/image --> PUT request to update the ranking variable on the server, will return updated user object or some counter variable

note: even though signin isn't creating anything new we still send the data via a POST request because we don't want credentials to be sent as query strings as they constitute sensitive data. so they will be sent over HTTPS to avoid the man-in-the-middle problem.

this structure might change as we go through the project
